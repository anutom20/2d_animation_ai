# 2D Animation AI - V1 Specifications

## Project Overview
An AI-powered system that generates 2D animations using the Manim library based on text prompts. Users provide natural language descriptions, and the system generates and renders the corresponding animation.

## Core Components

### 1. Basic Manim Integration (Phase 1) (Done)
- Set up basic Manim scene creation and rendering
- Create sample animations to validate the pipeline
- Implement basic shapes, transformations, and text animations
- Define a standard output format and resolution

### 2. LangChain Integration (Phase 2) (Done)
- Set up LangChain agent with custom tools
- Create a Manim code generation tool
- Implement code execution and validation pipeline
- Handle error cases and provide feedback

### 3. AI Code Generation (Phase 3) (in progress)
- Design prompt engineering for Manim code generation
- Create templates for common animation patterns
- Implement safety checks for generated code
- Add support for basic animation primitives

### Token usage (phase 4)
- a way to track token usage and cost

## Technical Architecture

### API Layer
- FastAPI endpoints for:
  - Animation request submission
  - Status checking
  - Result retrieval

### Processing Pipeline
1. Text prompt intake
2. LangChain agent processing
3. Code generation
4. Code validation
5. Manim rendering
6. Result delivery

### Storage
- Temporary storage for generated animations
- Cache for common patterns
- Log storage for debugging

## Future Enhancements (Backlog)
1. Advanced animation features
   - Multiple scenes
   - Complex transitions
   - Custom styling
   
2. User Experience
   - Progress tracking
   - Preview generation
   - Animation customization options

3. Performance
   - Rendering optimization
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Parallel processing

4. Safety & Validation
   - Input sanitization
   - Resource limits
   - Error recovery

## V1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Successfully generate basic Manim animations
- [ ] Integrate LangChain for code generation
- [ ] Handle simple text-to-animation conversion
- [ ] Provide basic API endpoints
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Create basic documentation

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Manim library
- LangChain
- FastAPI
- Additional dependencies as needed

## Notes
- This is a living document that will be updated as the project evolves
- Focus on getting basic functionality working before adding complex features
- Maintain flexibility for future enhancements
